# ElectionSite

A fun project using React and TailwindCSS to display current polls (from 538 by ABC News) in each state on an interactive map. This project uses Python for backend code and handles data in a JSON format.

Also found on this site is my prediction for the Presidential election and a blog where I explain my reasoning.
